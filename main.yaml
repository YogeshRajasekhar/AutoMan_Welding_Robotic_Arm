## 🚀 Execution Workflow

1. 📐 **Import weld path from CAD**
2. 🔧 **Path smoothing and preprocessing**
3. 🎯 **Calculate start/end poses (Task space)**
4. 🔁 **Apply inverse kinematics → joint angles**
5. 🚗 **Waypoint interpolation**
6. 🤖 **End-effector position control**
7. ⚙️ **Impedance dynamics for realism**

## 📈 Control Methodology

### 🔁 Kinematics

- **Forward**: \( \Delta X = J(q) \cdot \Delta \theta \)  
- **Inverse**: \( \Delta \theta = J^{-1}(q) \cdot \Delta X \)

### 📌 Position Control

\[
X_{t+1} = X_d + K_p X_e + K_d \dot{X}_e + K_i \int X_e dt
\]

### 🛡️ Impedance Dynamics

\[
F = M(ẍ_d - ẍ) + D(ẋ_d - ẋ) + K(x_d - x)
\]
